# **🧬 Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**  

## **📌 Overview**  
This project applies multiple **machine learning algorithms** to classify **breast cancer tumors** as **benign** or **malignant** based on medical data. We utilize the `sklearn` dataset and compare the performance of various models.  

### **🔹 Features of the Project:**  
✅ Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
✅ Implementation of multiple ML models:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Decision Tree  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Random Forest  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Logistic Regression  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Artificial Neural Network (ANN)  
✅ Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Performance visualization using **Matplotlib**

## **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset is obtained from **Scikit-learn's `load_breast_cancer()`**. Key features include:  

- **Mean radius**  
- **Mean texture**  
- **Mean perimeter**  
- **Mean area**  
- **Mean smoothness**  
- **... and more (30 features in total)**  

**Target:**  
- `0` → Benign (non-cancerous)  
- `1` → Malignant (cancerous)
